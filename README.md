# World Map Earthquakes - (leaflet_challenge)

The present project contains a wolrd map with all the earthquakes ocurred in the last month (in the time the this map was created: Jul 2020) above a magnitude of 2.5.
  * The map was created with Leaflet.
  * Each event is pointed out with a marker. The color and size of it represents the intensity of the earthquake. 
  * Additionally, each marker displays additional info like the location of the event and at what deep did it originate.
Thanks!
